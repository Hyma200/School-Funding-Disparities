The goal of this project was to design an algorithm that proposes a better student
funding formula for Virginia counties based on differences in minority count in each 
county. So far, htmlunit was used to web scrape the enrollment numbers of Virginia
public school students. The EthnicityRecorder class was created for this purpose. Then
a pdf document of per student funding in each county was also webscraped using pdfbox and
another class, pdfreader, was created for this purpose. The line finder class is an
abstract class that searches for words and returns both the line numbers and text in 
those lines. The class was used both in the pdfreader and EthnicityRecorder classes. The
counties.java class is where information associated with each county is stored in. 
The test and tester classes are where I tested my code out before placing them in their
respective classes. Currently, I am working on the GUI class, where I plan on creating 
pie charts of the ethnicities associated with each class and displaying a summary of 
how much funding should be increased in each county. Before that, I plan to use my tester
classes to compute further calculations on calculaitons of county funding. So far, I 
gathered all the information necessary for my project by using various websites and 
documents to web scrape. At this stage of my project, I am basically trying to process
and display the informaiton I gathered.
